# Internet of Things Nmap Fingerprints

A repository of Nmap scans for various IoT devices. The following command was run to perform the scan:

	nmap -Pn -p- -A -oX <name> <ip>

Where **name** is a descriptive name for the device (ex: "wink-hub") and **ip** is the IP address the device has on your local network.

To have your Nmap scan results added to this repository either submit a pull request or send your XML file to support@shodan.io
